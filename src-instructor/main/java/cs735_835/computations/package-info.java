/**
 * Computations package.
 *
 * This package contains only one public interface: {@code Computation}.  It implements a notion of
 * computation that can be continued, and on which callbacks can be registered.  It offers methods
 * {@code map} and {@code onComplete} similar to methods on Scala's {@code Future} (or to the
 * methods {@code thenApply} and {@code thenRun} of Java's {@code CompletionStage}).
